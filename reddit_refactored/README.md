#A New Structure

As our Angular apps grow we'll need a new file structure.  It won't work to put everything in an `app.js` file when we have multiple controllers, modules, directives, filters, services, and more.  

We're going to start by using the following structure:

```
app
    css
    js
        app.js
        controllers.js
        directives.js
        filters.js
        services.js
    index.html
```

This structure is pretty simple.  We have an app.js file where we will declare our app and all dependencies.  For now it will just look like:

```js
var app = angular.module("whateverYourModuleNameIs")
```

We also have files like `controllers.js` and `directives.js` which contain all of our controllers or custom directives (we'll get there soon).  Basically, instead of writing everything inside of `app.js`, we've broken it out into separate files grouped by functionality.

In order for this structure to work, make sure you correctly include all the scripts in your `index.html` file.

Convert the reddit clone app to this new file structure

**EXERCISE: Serve your reddit clone app using http-server.  Make sure everything works correctly.**

The next thing we'll want to do is serve up our application using some sort of server.  For now we can just run `http-server -c-1 -o` inside of the app directory.  Visit `localhost:8080` to see the application.

## Questions

* What are possible issues with this new file structure?

Well possible issues from our previous reddit clone are simply that the relative paths in that project may not map well into this project. As for this file structure in general, the only real problem seems to be that more files require more linking between those files, so every .js file needs to linked to the html with a script tag, but interestingly there need not be much linking among them (i.e., no module.exports or require)

* What are the differences between serving files from an http server and from the file system?  It seemed to work fine with just `open index.html` in the browser...

Serving files from http server differs from serving from the file system because a server can respond to http requests whereas the file system cannot. As far as I understand, Angular emulates the http response and request cycle, though those response and request aren't actually happening over the http protocol because Angular serves all of the files upon the first response.
